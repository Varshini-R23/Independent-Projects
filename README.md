# Classification of Handwritten and Printed Text

The inspiration for this work was taken from the following paper:

A. Conci and A. Sanchez, "Automatic Discrimination between Printed and Handwritten Text in Documents," 2009 XXII Brazilian Symposium on Computer Graphics and Image Processing, Rio de Janiero, 2009, pp. 261-267, doi: 10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2009.40.

The paper goes over the entire pipeline of document image preprocessing and the principle of horizontal/vertical projections as a means to compare text snippets from different documents.
